1. I have successfully completed the Github onboarding instructions, and acknowledge that I shall never run the command `git push upstream` or `git push upstream main` against the main course repository. 

2. I have successfully setup my Python environment on my local machine using the setup instructions as needed, and acknowledge that I know how to submit assignments and project work through my personal fork of the course github repository. 

3. Assignments can be checked in up to 24 hours late with no penalty, and will incur a one-time 15% penalty thereafter. 

4. Incomplete tasks will not be penalized provided effort was made (which we can glean from the questions you ask and your git commit history)? 

5. All course materials can be found on Canvas and on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrislarson1/ANLY-580-FALL-2021.git). 

6. If I use a Windows operating system I should strongly consider installing VirtualBox such that I can interact with the course on a unix based operating system. 

7. As per Georgetown policy, I will keep my fork of this repository permanently *private* (i.e., forever), and not share course content and work with others. I understand that the course instructor has written a bot that will check this daily. 

8. I have understand the Georgetown academic integrity policies as laid out in the [Georgetown Honor System Handbook](https://honorcouncil.georgetown.edu/system/policies/), and that those policies apply to this class.
