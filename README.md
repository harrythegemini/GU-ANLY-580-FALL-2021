## Course Description
Natural language processing (NLP) is a critical component of modern information systems. The confluence of deep learning, massive datasets, and hardware accelerators has resulted in systems that approach and in some cases exceed human level performance on benchmark language tasks. In this course we will explore three principal questions: 1) how do we frame language understanding as a tractable statistical inference problem, 2) what are the current state-of-the-art modeling approaches, and 3) how are NLP systems designed and evaluated. In exploring these questions the course exposes students to the foundational math, implementation methods, practical applications, and current research directions in the field. The course will focus less on task-specific feature engineering in order to provide a more complete exposition of the methods that have proven to be most successful in real world applications such as web search, recommender systems, voice and text based chatbots, and machine translation. This course assumes a basic understanding of linear algebra, probability theory, first order optimization methods, and neural networks.

## Course Policies
Students are expected to adhere to all policies in the [Georgetown Honor System Handbook](https://honorcouncil.georgetown.edu/system/policies/), and be aware of [Title IX/Sexual Misconduct](https://sexualassault.georgetown.edu/resourcecenter). We take both of these matters seriously. All work submitted in this class is expected to be your own. In the case of code it is very common to use subroutines written by other people to perform specific tasks; this is OK but you must comment your code when doing so. Each student is required to acknowledge that they are aware of all course policies by completing the [course policy quiz](https://github.com/chrislarson1/GU-ANLY-580-FALL-2021/blob/main/quizzes/quiz-1.md). In person attendance is highly recommended for students in section II.

*Note: All submissions are due 11:59pm EST on the dates listed. Submissions turned in more than 24 hours late will be assessed a one-time 15% penalty.*

**Lab Grading**: Labs are due at the end of the semester (except for Lab-01, which only covers onboarding related material and is due Sep 08). This flexibility is not license to fall behind; the goal is for you to spend the time that is necessary to familiarize yourself with the models, algorithms, and design patterns covered in this course, not test how quickly you can learn the material on a cursory level. There will be 10 graded labs each worth 2%, and one extra credit lab. Each lab task will be graded on a complete/incomplete basis, however incomplete tasks will not necessarily be penalized provided that effort was made to complete them (which we can glean from your git commit history and the questions you ask).

**Final Project Grading**: The rubrik for the final project will be included in the project description released during Lab-07.


## Github Onboarding
Students will submit assignments, labs, quizzes, and the project to private forks of [this repository](https://github.com/chrislarson1/GU-ANLY-580-FALL-2021.git) which the instructor and TAs will have access to. Setup instructions are [here](https://github.com/chrislarson1/GU-ANLY-580-FALL-2021/blob/main/github-setup.md). If you are viewing this on canvas, you can view these instructions in `Module-1: github-setup.html`.


## Box
Students of this course will have access to recorded lectures and other large files via Georgetown's Box account, which is free for Faculty and Students. The course Box link is [here](https://georgetown.box.com/s/x8aw4tekp92ip4s5qf2l5hgl3hca9trg).
