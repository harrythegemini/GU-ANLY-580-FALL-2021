Here we are suggesting you create a dictionary that maps each word to a unique $ith$ index in the $\\phi_{i,k}$ probabilty matrix, which you need to estimate. Because the labels are a set of 0-indexed integers, they naturally map to a unique position $\\mu_{k}$ (you should check this to make sure)."

    "# Part II: Model performance evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the performance of a classification model may seem as simple as computing an accuracy, and in some cases that is sufficient, but in general accuracy is not a reliable metric by itself. Typically we need to evaluate our model using several different metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common issue is class imbalance, which is when the label distribution in the data varies far from uniform. In this case a high accuracy can be misleading because low frequency labels don't contribute equally to the score. More generally, this is one of the biggest drawbacks of using MLE in NLP: models tend to be much less sensitive to low probability labels than to higher probabilty labels. Later in this class we will explore models that learn by predicting words given their context, can you think of reasons why this can be problematic? Hint: remember Zipf's law?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason to use multiple evaluation methods is that it can help you better understand your data. Evaluating performance on individual classes often reveals problems with the data that would otherwise go unnoticed. For example, if you observe an abundance of misclassified data specific to only a few classes, chances are you have inconsistent labels for those classes in the training set. This is very common in 3rd party mechanical turk data, where quality can vary wildly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will use three metrics and one visualization tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)\n",
    "2. [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-score)\n",
